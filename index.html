    <p>
      Welcome! I am University Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of Arkansas where I held various academic appointments – including founding director of the Diane Blair Center’s annual Arkansas Poll – from 1998–2024. Although I remain active in the profession, I now find a lot of fulfillment holding assorted service-sector jobs in my beautiful hometown of Spokane, Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enthusiastic teacher of more than 6,000 students at all levels, including many who now serve as elected or appointed public servants, I have authored/coauthored more than 50 scholarly publications on voter behavior, women in politics, ballot measures, and more, and provided political analysis to regional, national, and international news outlets including the <em>New York Times</em>, NPR, the Associated Press, the BBC, and many more. I also enjoyed wearing all manner of public service hats, including steering a Status of Women in Arkansas report for the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in 2002, directing the university’s Teaching and Faculty Support Center, chairing the Faculty Senate, and serving on the board of the incomparable Fayetteville Public Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the lucky parent of two amazing adult children (the wonder twins!), as well as three awesome adult stepchildren, and am happily partnered with writer/valet/adventurer, Matt McGowan.
